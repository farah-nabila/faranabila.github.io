<font face="Times New Roman" size="4" align="justify">My first experience is during my practical training. It was a great experience that I never forget. 
There I get more knowledge in library field. This training also teaches me be responsible with the task given. I had my practical training at <b>Tun Dr. Ismail Library.</b> 
This library are big but did not has many staff. Although there are not many staff, they still friendly and have a consideration towards me. They always ask whether I have problems on task given.
 For me, it was memorable experience because it was difficult to get at other place.</br></br>
During my training, I get more knowledge about library and how they run the library. The things that I learn at the university, I could practice it when I works. It was really best working experience
because what I studies I get to do it in real works. So, it was good experience that I will never forget and I cannot get again in other place. </font>

</br></br>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4" align="justify">The other experience that I have is when I get to make interview session with my friends as a requirement of my subject. It was a good 
experience because I get to gain more knowledge about the place where we interview. There have 2 place that I get to make an interview which is at <b>Perpustakaan Sultanah Bahiyah in Univertisity Utara Malaysia (UUM)</b> for library
technology interview and at <b>Rumah Sarapan</b> for business interview. During the interviews, I get more knowledge about the subject interview and place that we go. I will never forget this experience because
it was my first time had interview with people and the journey to interview place is the best memory and experience that I will never forget.</font>
